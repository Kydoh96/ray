    "# Running a Simple MapReduce Example with Ray Core\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we're discussing how easy it can be to use Ray to implement MapReduce, a significant milestone in distributed computing.\n",
    "Many popular big data technologies, such as Hadoop, are built upon this programming model, and it is worth discussing in relation to Ray.\n",
    "To illustrate its use, we will use a simple example of counting word occurrences across multiple documents.\n",
    "While this may seem like a straightforward task when working with a small number of documents,\n",
    "it becomes more complex when dealing with a large corpus, requiring the use of multiple compute nodes to process the data.\n",
    "This is a commonly used example in distributed computing and is worth learning about.\n",
    "The approach involves three simple steps:"

    "1. Use a set of documents as the input and apply a specified function to transform or \"map\" each element within them (such as the words contained in the documents).\n",
    "   This map phase will produce key-value pairs, where the key represents an element in the document and the value is a metric calculated for that element.\n",
    "   In this particular case, the goal is to count the number of times each word appears in a document,\n",
    "   so the map function will output the pair `(word, 1)` every time a word is encountered to show that it has been found once.\n",
    "2. All the outputs from the map phase are collected and organized based on their key.\n",
    "   This may involve transferring data between different nodes, as the same key could potentially be found on multiple compute nodes.\n",
    "   This process is commonly referred to as the shuffle phase.\n",
    "   As an example, if the map phase produces four occurrences of the pair `(word, 1)`, the shuffle phase will ensure that all occurrences of\n",
    "   the same word are located on the same node.\n",
    "3. The reduce phase is so named because it aggregates or combines the elements from the shuffle step.\n",
    "   Using the example provided, the final count of a word's occurrences is obtained by adding up all the occurrences on each node.\n",
    "   For example, four instances of `(word, 1)` would be combined to result in a final count of `word: 4`."
